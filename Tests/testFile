Once upon a time, there was a man who had some interesting things to say. // TODO: Figure out what he should say.
These things weren't that interesting, and in fact, they were quite trite,
you could say that he was not good at saying anything at all // TODO: But why would the user care?
                                                             // what should they do to handle this double line comment?
Well after that
I suppose that you could comclude that this is not // TODO: 'conclude', not 'comclude'.
thjat great
